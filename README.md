# 🚀 Synkora — Hyperlocal Skill Exchange Platform

**Learn what you need by teaching what you know.**

Synkora is a community-driven skill exchange platform where users can **teach a skill they know** and **learn a skill they want**.  
Instead of depending only on money, Synkora uses a **credit-based learning model** to make education more **affordable, accessible, and inclusive**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

Many learners want to gain new skills, but paid courses, mentors, and private sessions are often expensive. At the same time, many people already have valuable skills they can share.

**Synkora solves this problem by turning knowledge into value.**

On Synkora, users can:

- 🧠 Teach what they know
- 📚 Learn what they want
- 🔄 Exchange skills with other users
- 💳 Earn credits by teaching
- 📍 Connect with relevant users
- 💸 Use paid learning when exchange is not possible

This creates a fair learning ecosystem where users can grow through **teaching, learning, and collaboration**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Access to learning is often limited by:

- 💸 High cost of courses and mentorship
- 🌍 Limited access to quality learning opportunities
- 🤝 Lack of platforms for peer-to-peer skill exchange
- ⚖️ Unequal access to practical, community-driven education

Many users have the ability to teach, but no platform exists where they can use that skill to earn learning opportunities in return.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Synkora is a **peer-to-peer skill exchange platform** that enables users to learn skills without depending only on money.

### The core idea:
A user can **learn a new skill by teaching a skill they already know**.

To support this, Synkora provides:

- **Skill-based matching**
- **Matching probability**
- **Credit-based learning**
- **Profile-based discovery**
- **Paid learning fallback option**

This makes learning more flexible and accessible for people who may not be able to afford traditional learning resources.

---

## 🔄 Credit-Based Learning System

Synkora introduces a **time-credit model** to reduce direct money flow and encourage community learning.

### Rules:
- **1 hour of teaching = 1 credit earned**
- **1 hour of learning = 1 credit spent**

### How it works:
- Users teach others to earn credits
- Users spend credits to learn new skills
- Credits are added only after sessions are completed
- This ensures fairness and encourages real participation

---

## 🧠 Matching Engine

Synkora’s matching engine does not only show strict reciprocal matches.

It shows:

- Relevant users
- Matching probability
- Better-ranked skill partners

### Example:
If two users have exact reciprocal skill requirements, the system can show a **100% match**.

This improves discovery and increases the chance of finding a useful learning partner.
